# Subreddit-Recommender
Placing social media content in the relevant community of users is a challenging task. The popularity of the post de- pends on factors like the time it is posted and the group it targets, apart from the quality of the content as such. Reddit is a highly trafficked social media website which has more than 203 million users and 7,700 active, user-created communities. Finding the right thread to post the specific content is crucial to gain the attention of the users. The proposed model helps the user better place the post by sug- gesting the subreddit thatâ€™s more likely to give better votes. This is achieved by proposing a two-step model. The first step outputs a set of likely subreddits that the post can belong to and in the second step we use a suite of subreddit- specific classifiers to score the post in the context of that subreddit. We then pick the subreddit which maximizes the potential score and produce that as the output.
